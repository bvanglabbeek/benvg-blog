<Layout title="About Ben">
  <h1>Hi, I’m Ben van Glabbeek</h1>

  <p>
    I’m a business and technology transformation leader based in Atlanta, GA, with a deep background in Agile operating models, enterprise modernization, and organizational change. I’ve spent over two decades helping companies work smarter, ship faster, and build cultures that actually enjoy showing up on Monday.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most recently, I served as a Technology Director at <strong>Wizeline</strong>, leading global transformation initiatives and designing systems that help businesses move with speed and purpose. Before that, I was VP of Business Transformation at <strong>Fiserv</strong>, where I advised executive leadership on operating model design and post-M&A technology integration—work that impacted over 20,000 employees worldwide.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve also held roles as an Agile coach, technology director, and startup founder, with experience across cloud, mobile, and enterprise systems. My approach is grounded in <strong>people-centered, outcomes-first thinking</strong>, always looking for ways to improve flow, reduce delivery friction, and spark a little joy in the process.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Believe</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Better flow + joyful teams = sustainable value</li>
    <li>Strategy is only as good as the system that supports it</li>
    <li>Change sticks when it’s co-created, not dictated</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    In both technology and leadership, I believe great outcomes come from four essential ingredients: <strong>Flow, Quality, Joy, and Value</strong>. That philosophy shapes how I lead transformations, coach teams, and support young leaders through Scouting.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flow</strong>: Reduce friction. Deliver continuously. Design systems that make work easier, not harder.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality</strong>: Build it right the first time—and build the right thing. Quality is everyone’s job, not just QA.</li>
    <li><strong>Joy</strong>: Create environments where people want to be. Joy fuels creativity, safety, and staying power.</li>
    <li><strong>Value</strong>: Focus on what matters most to the people you're serving—not just what's easy to measure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Transformation isn’t about adopting a framework or chasing a trend. It’s about <em>unlearning what doesn’t serve you</em>, running real experiments, and helping your people thrive. Whether it's launching an AI innovation lab or leading a Scout troop through the woods, I believe in learning by doing, staying curious, and always moving forward.
  </p>

  <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
  <p>
    When I’m not helping organizations transform, I’m focused on building the next generation of leaders through outdoor adventure. I volunteer as the Scoutmaster for <strong>Troop 10</strong>, where I lead camping trips, high-adventure outings, and leadership training for Scouts aged 11–17. Helping young people grow in confidence, character, and teamwork has been one of the most rewarding parts of my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our troop follows a simple set of guiding principles—ones that reflect both how we lead and how we grow:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>100% Youth Led:</strong> Scouts make decisions. Adults let them.</li>
    <li><strong>Learn by Doing:</strong> Mistakes are part of the process. Growth comes from reflection and peer coaching.</li>
    <li><strong>Have Fun:</strong> Joy builds resilience, connection, and confidence.</li>
    <li><strong>Community over Self:</strong> Give back, support each other, and put the group first.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Pragmatic:</strong> Progress over perfection. Let it be messy and meaningful.</li>
    <li><strong>Glass Half Full:</strong> Assume positive intent. Be generous in how you interpret others.</li>
    <li><strong>Work as a Patrol, Work as a Troop:</strong> If it’s not working, fix it together.</li>
    <li><strong>Go Outside:</strong> Nature is a classroom, a refuge, and a gift. Use it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Whether it’s mentoring future engineers or hiking through the backcountry with Scouts, I believe leadership is best developed through experience, shared challenge, and reflection.
