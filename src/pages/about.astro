      <p>
        Hi there, I'm Ben van Glabbeek. My path has been shaped by two seemingly different worlds that, in my experience, share profound connections: technology transformation and leadership development. Through both, I've discovered the importance of adaptability, continuous learning, and finding joy in the process of creating value.
      </p>

      <p>
        After navigating the technology landscape from startups to Fortune 500 companies, I've come to see transformation not just as a business strategy but as a philosophy. I've led teams in reimagining what's possible when technology and human ingenuity converge. Whether designing cloud solutions, modernizing legacy systems, or exploring the frontiers of AI, I've found that the most meaningful work happens at the intersection of technical excellence and human-centered design.

      <h2>The Four Principles</h2>
      <p>
       Throughout my journey, I've developed a framework of four interconnected principles that guide my approach to both technology and leadership:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> I believe in thinking end-to-end, from concept to customer. In my experience, removing barriers between teams and eliminating wait states creates an environment where ideas can flow smoothly into valuable outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Quality isn't just inspection at the end—it's built into every step of the process. Drawing inspiration from lean, I believe in creating systems where problems are surfaced immediately and solving them becomes everyone's responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Joy:</strong> Joy transcends momentary happiness. It's what happens when people connect deeply with meaningful work and understand how their contributions matter. Creating joy means helping teams connect with purpose rather than just executing tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Value:</strong> Even technically excellent solutions fail if they don't deliver real value to users. I've learned that value emerges at the intersection of technical capabilities and human needs, ensuring we build solutions that matter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where Trails Cross</h2>
      <p>
        This blog represents the confluence of my professional journey and personal passions—a place where different paths intersect and fresh perspectives emerge. Here, I share insights, experiments, and reflections that span the landscapes I traverse:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The delicate art of transforming organizations while respecting their unique cultures</li>
        <li>Leadership lessons learned through experimentation and continuous learning</li>
        <li>The search for simplicity and meaning in increasingly complex systems</li>
        <li>My adventures on the trail and what I'm doing next</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outside the Office</h2>
      <p>
        As Scoutmaster of Troop 10, I apply my leadership philosophy in a completely different context. Our troop operates on principles that remarkably parallel my professional approach: 100% youth-led, learning by doing, valuing community over self, and maintaining a pragmatic focus on progress over perfection. This role has taught me that leadership development is most effective when people face real challenges with real consequences, and when they're given the space to make mistakes and learn from them—whether in the boardroom or the backcountry.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Experimentation and Learning</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in thinking for ourselves and solving our own problems rather than blindly adopting packaged methods. I run experiments constantly—small, focused efforts to improve flow, quality, joy, and value in the systems I work with. Some succeed brilliantly; others fail instructively. All provide learning that builds toward better systems and more effective leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the best insights come when we step away from our usual environments and gain fresh perspective. Whether in the wilderness or the boardroom, I find that changing our context often reveals solutions we couldn't otherwise see.
