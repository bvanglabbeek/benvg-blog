    <div class="about-section">
      <p>
        I'm a business and technology transformation leader based in Atlanta, GA, with a deep background in Agile operating models, enterprise modernization, and organizational change. I've spent over two decades helping companies work smarter, ship faster, and build cultures that actually enjoy showing up on Monday.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've scaled distributed engineering organizations across the U.S., India, and LATAM, led transformations impacting 20,000+ employees, and helped Fortune 500 clients modernize cloud platforms, data systems, and software delivery lifecycles. I work closely with executive teams, sales, and delivery leaders to design scalable solutions that unify product, architecture, and operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most recently, I served as a Technology Director at Wizeline, leading global transformation initiatives and designing systems that help businesses move with speed and purpose. Before that, I was VP of Business Transformation at Fiserv, where I advised executive leadership on operating model design and post-M&A technology integration—work that impacted over 20,000 employees worldwide.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've also held roles as an Agile coach, technology director, and startup founder, with experience across cloud, mobile, and enterprise systems. My approach is grounded in people-centered, outcomes-first thinking, always looking for ways to improve flow, reduce delivery friction, and spark a little joy in the process.

      <h2>What I Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Better flow</strong> + joyful teams = sustainable value</li>
        <li>Strategy is only as good as the system that supports it</li>
        <li>Change sticks when it's co-created, not dictated</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        The lessons I apply in the woods—listen deeply, plan lightly, adjust often—are the same ones that help tech organizations thrive in uncertainty. I believe great outcomes come from four essentials: <strong>Flow, Quality, Joy, and Value</strong>. That philosophy shapes how I lead transformations, coach teams, and mentor young leaders—whether in the office or the trail.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Reduce friction. Deliver continuously. Design systems that make work easier, not harder.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Build it right the first time—and build the right thing.</li>
        <li><strong>Joy:</strong> Create environments where people want to be. Joy fuels creativity, safety, and staying power.</li>
        <li><strong>Value:</strong> Focus on what matters most to the people you're serving—not just what's easy to measure.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Transformation isn't about adopting a framework or chasing a trend. It's about unlearning what doesn't serve you, running real experiments, and helping your people thrive. Whether it's launching an AI innovation lab or leading a Scout troop through the woods, I believe in learning by doing, staying curious, and always moving forward.

      <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
      <p>
        As an Eagle Scout, I’ve seen how outdoor challenges and peer leadership can change lives—and I try to bring that same spirit to the boardroom and the backlog. Today, I volunteer as Scoutmaster for Troop 10, helping guide youth through outdoor adventure, personal growth, and hands-on leadership.
      </p>

      <p>We keep things simple, fun, and Scout-led—and I carry those same values into my work with teams and clients.</p>
