      I help organizations unlock meaningful change through clarity, experimentation, and better ways of working. Digital transformation isn’t just about technology—it’s about designing systems that improve <strong>flow</strong>, deliver <strong>value</strong>, and make room for <strong>joy</strong> in the work itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you’re wrestling with outdated delivery models, planning for AI, or rethinking your org design, I partner with teams to turn aspiration into execution—without defaulting to buzzwords, off-the-shelf frameworks, or one-size-fits-all solutions.
    </p>

    <p>Here’s how I help:</p>

      <li><strong>Emerging Tech & AI Integration</strong> – Cut through the noise. Build an AI strategy grounded in real value and real people.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic Planning & Execution</strong> – Translate bold ideas into executable plans—and build the system needed to make them real.</li>
      <li><strong>Digital Solution Delivery</strong> – From prototype to production, I help teams build better digital products and services.</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise Agile Transformation</strong> – Bring agility to life at every level—from the portfolio to the squad—without losing your soul.</li>
