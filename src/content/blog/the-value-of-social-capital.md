Recently I have been exploring what makes great teams and I came across a compelling concept—**social capital**. This notion, gleaned from the book [*Beyond Measure*](https://www.ted.com/read/ted-books/ted-books-library/beyond-measure), posits that it's not merely individual abilities or unique skills that set exceptional teams apart. 

Indeed, the metaphor of a brick wall illustrates this perfectly. While the bricks—each symbolizing a distinct skill or talent—are undoubtedly important, they alone can't build a resilient structure.

The strength of a brick wall lies significantly in the **mortar**—the binding element that transforms a disordered pile of bricks into a durable, unified structure. Herein lies the essential insight: the mortar represents the **social capital** within a team. It's this interconnectedness—the strong interpersonal bonds, shared values, mutual trust, and the spirit of collaboration—that truly galvanizes a group of individuals into a high-performing, unified team.

Countless studies validate this idea, showing that teams bound by robust social capital often outperform groups composed of high-IQ individuals. In other words, it's the power of **unity**, rather than individual intelligence, that makes teams more impactful, efficient, and resilient. The flip side is also true—a weak mortar, and the team crumbles. The wall falls not because of the individuals but the fragile glue connecting them.

Reflecting on these insights, I see the profound role social capital has played in my own team-building experiences. In one of my earliest teams, the collective power far outweighed the individual strengths. Each member brought unique competencies to the table, and while we all had strong agility backgrounds, none claimed the title of *the ultimate expert*. We recognized the importance of collective problem-solving and innovation to achieve our shared goals.

Diverse viewpoints, animated discussions, and even disagreements were a part of our journey. But rather than creating discord, they **reinforced** our bond—the mortar in our wall. This potent social capital transformed us into a formidable force, driving us toward significant achievements.

So, as you struggle with your team, and wonder why it’s not working. Pause and think about how strong the mortar is between your team members. If they form a well-bonded team, you’ll be amazed by the innovative solutions they can generate both collaboratively and individually. If you’re always the glue maybe it’s time to invest in expanding the social capital.
